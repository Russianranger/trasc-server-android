TRASC Server Android **0.2.1** fixes the session and log export failures reported on the Thor.

Install this APK over **TRASC Server Preview 0.1.2 or 0.2.0**. It uses the same application ID and pinned signing certificate. Shut down the runtime before updating. Your existing runtime 1.1, source, maps, database and binaries are retained; this APK update needs no server recompile.

- **Session export/import:** accept valid Debian `:arm64` filenames while retaining path traversal and drive-prefix checks.
- **Logs:** native Android listing, viewing and ZIP export work with the runtime closed, including after a failed session backup. Both log export buttons work without the localhost control service.
- **Recovery:** backup failures are recorded in `app.log` and explain whether the runtime is stopped. No game processes restart automatically.
- **Regression checks:** exact reported filename, full published-runtime backup/restore, native log bundles without Python, and the failed-backup/closed-runtime UI flow.

All 0.2.0 management features remain included:

- **Gameplay:** all database/source rules in searchable, collapsible categories; types and established bounds checked with field names in errors; save only modified rules.
- **Setup:** apply the legacy Nektulos map/nav pair with original-file backups, and revert it.
- **Server:** create and export a complete session ZIP. It stops the session cleanly and includes runtime, database, SQL snapshot, binaries, maps, logs, sources/builds, configuration, backups and imported client.
- **Setup:** restore that ZIP into a fresh app without downloading a runtime or recompiling. Checksums, modes and symlinks are verified/restored before activation. Existing sessions have a recovery generation.
- **Client:** ZIP import, private temporary-ZIP cleanup, DLL inventory, saved controller-to-keyboard/mouse bindings and a focused input diagnostic. Client launch/rendering/DLL loading remain a later phase.
- **Continuity:** implementation decisions, validation and remaining work are recorded in `docs/HANDOFF.md`.

For this device pass, export logs while the runtime is closed, then retry complete session export and restoration. Continue the rules and Nektulos tests afterward. Client testing remains explicitly deferred. See `docs/device-tests.md` for the sequence.

Backups contain accounts, credentials and client files and are not encrypted. Save them privately outside the app. Only the private temporary copy of an imported session/client ZIP is removed; the selected source document remains intact.

**Older 0.1.0/0.1.1 installations:** their signing key was lost before 0.1.2, so this Preview application installs alongside them. Their data is not transferred automatically. Export the database, source/maps archives and edited files, stop the old runtime, and import into Preview. Do not uninstall the old app until migration is verified. Only run one runtime at a time because the ports are shared.

`preview-build.json` identifies the exact commit, APK checksum, application ID and signing certificate. Publication requires backend/JVM tests, ARM64 database integration, APK compilation and lint. New Android management workflows still require the user's device acceptance tests.
